Dear Customer:

Thanks so much for taking the time to share your network plans and discussing the ways in which Arista can take your business to the next level. 

We are excited to share the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. This is the third consecutive year Arista is being recognized as a leader.

We believe our increased positioning in the ¡°Leaders¡± quadrant by Gartner, based on ability to execute and completeness of vision, is validation of continued market acceptance of Arista EOS and our Universal Cloud Architecture. Our innovations in cloud management, telemetry and containerized EOS (cEOS) are changing the way customers build cloud-scale networks.

We look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Arista Networks
